My name is Benjamin Fischer and I'm a 24 year old computer science student.
Currently, I'm studying in my last semester before writing my master's thesis at the university FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg.

### Coding
Programming and developing software has become a real passion over time and I always try to improve my skills.
I'm no experienced developer yet, but I'm working on it!
I have some experience in multiple programming languages and technologies/frameworks,
but I definetely would consider Python as my main programming language.
If you want to know more about these topics or my deepening lectures,
just send me an e-mail or view my profile on LinkedIn.

### My free time

Besides programming, I enjoy playing football or meeting my friends.
Additionaly, I like cooking and listening to music or playing the guitar myself.
There's obviously something missing at the end: relaxing and watching series and movies (:
