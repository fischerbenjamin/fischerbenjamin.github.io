My name is Benjamin Fischer and I am a 26 year old software developer from Germany.
I have studied computer science at the university FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg from 2014 to 2021.
I finished with my master degree in summer 2021.
Since then, I have been working as a software developer on a project for metadata management and analysis.
My focus is on the backend implementation (Python) as well as the CI/CD pipeline.
