My name is Benjamin Fischer and I'm a 24 year old computer science student.
Currently, I'm studying for my final semester before writing a master's thesis
at the university FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. Feel free to send me an e-mail if you
have any questions or want to know more about any of these topics.

### Programming
I started programming during my first semester of University (2014).
Since then, I have gained experience in various programming languages and frameworks.
My favourite language is definitely __Python__, followed by __JavaScript__.
Not to mention, I've been working with __Linux__, __Git__, __Bash__ and __LaTeX__
for quite some time now.

### Specialization
Here's a short overview of the lectures I attended in my studies
and therefore have some experince on the corresponding topic.
Due to the fact that many of these classes were held in German,
the names are translated into English.

* __Theoretical Computer Science__
  * Modal Logic
  * Organic Computing
  * Efficient Combinatorial Algorithms
  * Approximation Algorithms
* __IT-Security__
  * Forensics
  * Applied IT-Security
* __Software Engineering__
  * Advanced Design and Programming
  * Advanced Methods of Software Engineering
  * Agile Methods and Open Source
* __Others__
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Operating Systems
