This is an overview about my personal projects and the ones I collaborate on.

### [Metadata-Hub](https://github.com/amos-project2/metadata-hub)

I'm collaborating on the Metadata-Hub application as a software developer.

The goal of this project is to create a prototype for intelligently crawling large file systems
and make the collected information accessible to the end-user.
It is developed in the course of the [AMOS](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/amos/) project.

### [MeinBundestag](https://github.com/fischerbenjamin/meinbundestag)

*MeinBundestag* is an application about the German parliament.
It provides information about the deputies of the current election period and allows
the user to read the speeches held in the parliament.

I developed this application in the course of the 
[Advanced Methods of Software Engineering](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/amse) lecture.

The goal of this application is to make these kind of information easily accessible by
providing a mobile application and therefore increase the political interest of its users.

Unfortunately, I've had no time yet to continue developing this application.
Thus, there is no installable version of it in one of the app stores.

### FilesystemAnalyzer [upcoming]

In this project, I want to examine how files and directories are distributed in regular file systems. 
There's probably no real use case for this application in general, but I am curios about the results
it will generate.
