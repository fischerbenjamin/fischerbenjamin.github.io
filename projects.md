### [Metadata-Hub](https://github.com/amos-project2/metadata-hub)

I collaborated on the Metadata-Hub application as a SD in
the course of the [AMOS](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/amos/) project.

The goal of this project was to create a prototype for intelligently crawling
large file systems and make the collected information accessible to the end-user.

### [MeinBundestag](https://github.com/fischerbenjamin/meinbundestag)

I developed this application in the course of the 
[AMSE](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/amse) lecture.

*MeinBundestag* is an application about the German parliament.
It provides information about the deputies of the current election period and
allows the user to read the speeches held in the parliament. The goal of this
application is to make this kind of information easily accessible by
providing a mobile application and therefore increase the political interest
of its users. Unfortunately, I've had no time yet to continue developing
this application. Thus, there is no installable version of it in one of the app
stores.
